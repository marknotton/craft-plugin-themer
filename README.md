# Themer *for Craft CMS*

> This plugin is no longer maintained. I'm committing to Craft 3 development only. Feel free to use the source code as you like. If you're looking for a Craft 3 version of this plugin, it's likely I've merged parts or all of this plugin into my [Helpers module.](https://github.com/marknotton/craft-module-helpers)

Brand up your Craft CMS with colour themes.

## TODO:
- Fix the default options option, so it updates the styles on the page
- Add option to include image background
- Add a collection premade themes
- Add more options as to what can be themed.
